        Although this is an entirely different site separate from our previous assignment, I'm trying the two-true/one-false thing anyway. Why not? It's not like I have anything else to put here...
        <br>Well, here they are:
        <br> • I found inserting the javascript easy and by no means had countless problems with script tags and thing randomly not running
        <br> • Were the above to be true, I would be completely calm and not at all hold a grudge against the nonsentient compiler
        <br> • Creating this website was an entirely smooth process with no hitches whatsoever
